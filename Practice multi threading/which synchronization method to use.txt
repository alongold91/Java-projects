Quick decision guide:
* Simple protection -> synchronized
* Need flexibility -> ReentrantLock
* Thread coordination -> wait/notify or Condition
* Resource pooling (managing a limited set of shared resources that multiple threads/processes can use, but not all at the same time) -> Semaphore
* High performance, rare conflicts -> Atomic classes (optimistic)
